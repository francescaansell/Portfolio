                    Hi! My name is Francesca Ansell and I will be graduating from Penn State College of IST this May. Between both the classroom and an internship at Merck I have gained experience in Front 
                    End Development, User Experience, User Interface Design, and Project Management. This summer in my role at Merck I learned to communicate effectivity between 
                    IT and the Business. I used my problem-solving skills to organize information, streamline workflows and increased productivity. 
                    My greatest goal is to make an impact on the healthcare system by applying an exceptional user experience to consumer engagement.
